I'm sending you are all the alien transmissions I could gather.

I've named the files as 't<number of transmission>_<label>_<number of messages>.msgs'.

I have labeled the files that I believe completely consist of
valid messages with _clean.

I've also included the number of messages I could manually find in each transmission.

Please, write me a program that automates this process: the future of humanity
depends on you!
